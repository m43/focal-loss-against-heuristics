# MNLI Matched Hard
Hardness dataset from [robust-nli](https://github.com/rabeehk/robust-nli), in the format that the authors have used in their pipeline. A datapoint is considered "hard" if a simple fastText classifier (Joulin et al., 2017), misclassified it, as done in (Gururangan et al., 2018). This is because the classifier is rather simple and must rely on syntactic heuristics/biases in the dataset.
